Bugs:
- Enemies all follow exactly the same path, so can end up clustered on top of
  each other. Use flocking rules to keep them separated.
- Sometimes non-occluding walls get hidden
- Performance is terrible on the 3rd level (too much raycasting to find
  occluding walls?)
- When you complete the final level, the game hangs

Gameplay:
- levels are too large, it's too hard to find the exit
  - make the tile size smaller
  - lay out the coins so that following them leads you to the exit (but you
    might miss some other treasures on the way)?
- enemies
  - spawn logic
  - combat?
- loot can be cash or items (including health packs!)
- some way to level up.
- title / menu screen.
- high score screen.
- controls need work
  - turning is too twitchy.
  - have turning speed accelerate up to a maximum.
  - likewise with running speed - accelerate (quickly) up to a maximum speed.
- Have a time limit for each level, instead of a stopwatch?
- Keep loot acquired from previous levels.
- Minimap???

Polish:
- 3D models
  - player
  - loot
  - enemies
- Animation
- Textures
  - more than one!
  - bump maps
- Sound effects:
  - when you're moving
  - when you take a hit
  - when you launch an attack
  - when you die
  - when an enemy attacks
  - when an enemy dies
  - when you start a new level
  - when you finish a level
- Music/ambient sounds
  - Wind whistling
  - Water dripping
- Icons
  - Get rid of placeholder icons
  - Icon for "life"
  - Icon for "gold"
  - Icon for "time taken"

Technical:
- generate new levels dynamically as you progress through the game
  - unload old levels after you leave them
- have enemies spawn using same logic as L4D
  - use an estimate of emotional intensity of player to decide when/what to
    spawn.
  - use flow distance to decide where to spawn.
- better loot placement
  - pick a fixed flow distance for each loot, but choose a random tile at that
    distance.
  - or, lay them in a trail between the starting point and the exit.
  - randomise placement within a tile.



Minimalism means getting rid of things from the traditional Action RPG formula:
- inventory management (you can carry everything you find)
- skill tree (no choices when levelling up, you just get tougher)
- but... RPGs are about personalisation - how do we keep that?

Minimal necessary components of an RPG:
- exploration
- loot
- combat
- personalisation


Possible sequels:
- Dungeon Fighter (where you fight the enemies rather than running away from them)
- Dungeon Sneaker (where you attempt to use stealth and avoid the enemies)
- Dungeon Caster (where you're a wizard)
