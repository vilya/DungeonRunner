Bugs:
- If you walk into a wall, you can't walk back off it - you have to turn around to walk out.

Gameplay:
- loot can be cash or items
- enemies
  - spawn logic
  - pathfinding
  - combat
- some way to level up.
- title / menu screen.
- high score screen.
- win/lose conditions

Polish:
- 3D models
  - player
  - loot
  - enemies
- Textures
  - more than one!
- Sound effects:
  - when you're moving
  - when you take a hit
  - when you launch an attack
  - when you die
  - when an enemy attacks
  - when an enemy dies
  - when you start a new level
  - when you finish a level
- Music/ambient sounds

Technical:
- generate new levels dynamically as you progress through the game
  - unload old levels after you leave them
- have enemies spawn using same logic as L4D
  - use an estimate of emotional intensity of player to decide when/what to spawn.
  - use flow distance to decide where to spawn.
- better loot placement
  - pick a fixed flow distance for each loot, but choose a random tile at that distance.
  - randomise placement within a tile.



Minimalism means getting rid of things from the traditional Action RPG formula:
- inventory management (you can carry everything you find)
- skill tree (no choices when levelling up, you just get tougher)
- but... RPGs are about personalisation - how do we keep that?

Minimal necessary components of an RPG:
- exploration
- loot
- combat
- personalisation
